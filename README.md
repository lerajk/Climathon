# Climathon
Hackathon organized by Lighthouse Labs to reduce carbon emissions using NASA Satellite Big Data

Problem Statement: Reduce carbon emissons by 5% from the atmostphere with the help of Big Data.

Our proposed Hack / Solution: An interactive Google Map (for Toronto) which illustarted the CO2 and Methane levels at a particular place when a pin is placed. Also, the map demonstrated the traffic congestion areas in the city of Toronto with Toronto Open Source Data. 

This information will allow for the identification of the problem. The Government officials would be able to change traffic routes and make transportation plans accordingly.

Technical Specs: HTML, Javascript, Ajax, PHP, MYSQL, Python, Big data - HDF files, HDF Viewer and Skywatch APIs.
